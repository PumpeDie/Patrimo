We love your input! We want to make contributing to Patrimo as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. Make sure your code follows the existing style
5. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if necessary
2. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer

## Report Bugs Using GitHub's Issue Tracker

Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new).

## Write Bug Reports With Detail

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
